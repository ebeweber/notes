## Elements of Design

element is considered a basic unit of visual communication

+ space
+ line
+ shape / form
+ size / scale
+ color
+ texture
+ value

### Space

+ **positive space** is filled space. **negative space** is empty space.

### Line

+ **line** is used to delineate the limits of space or create positive space.
+ **baseline** line at the bottoms of the letters.

### Shape / Form

+ random lines form basic shapes
+ **shape** or **form** is the contours or profile
+ shape of most things is rectangule

### Size / Scale

the size of things

### Color

+ arguably most powerful communication tool
+ draws attention, orders, organizes, evokes emotion

### Texture

+ color and pattern create texture

### Value

+ tones of light and dark
+ **grayscale** is range of white and black and ranging grays


## Six Rules of Good Design

+ focal point / emphasis
+ contrast
+ balance
+ movement
+ rhythm / pattern
+ unity

### Focal Point

+ where the eye fixes
+ Rule No. 1: have a focal point so user knows where to look
+ Rule No. 2: limit one per screen or page

#### Golden Proportion

+ 1:1.618 compositional grid suggestion asymmetrical placement of items on the layout

#### Rule of Thirds

+ 3x3 grid to suggest placement

### Contrast

+ difference between elements

### Balance

+ balancing visual weight
+ radial balance refers to circular desgin where fulcrum lies at center

### Movement

+ good design controls eye's flow through composition
+ horizonal lines convey left to right movement
+ vertical lines communicate stability, inspiration
+ diagonal lines communicate dynamic movement
+ converging diagonal lines communicate distance
+ **flow** has to do with pattern of movement and the eye

### Rhythm / Pattern

+ repeating squares, stars, colors, fonts and numbered items

### Unity

+ all the parts of the design work together, everything belongs together

## Four Laws of Gestalt Theory

+ proximity
+ similarity
+ continuity
+ closure

### Proximity

+ we perceive objects **close** together as belonging to the same group
+ we prerceive objects that **move** together as belonging to same group

### Similarity / Unity

+ our minds group things with similar properties (colors and shapes)

### Continuity

+ our minds continue a pattern beyond its ending points
+ eyes follow beyond what is seen

### Closure

+ we mentally fill gaps to complete a perceived shape
