$Billion Dollar Gram

- grabbed numbers from news reports and scaled boxes accordingly
- easy way to quickly tell different of sizes, gives context


Mountains Out of Molehills

- timeline of global media panics by size
- twin peaks in violence of video games every year (April / November every year)
- September 2011 there's a gap


"data is the new oil"


What rises twice a year (Easter and two weeks before Christmas), mini-peak every Monday and flattens out over the summer?
Breakups according to Facebook status updates


Sight takes in the most information.
Touch takes in the next.
Sound and Smell.

All of this is pouring in, but we only are aware / process a tiny amount.


Viewing data normalized by different things (ex. total soldiers vs. soldiers per capita)
Relative figures can give a fuller pictures


Even if information is terrible the visualization can be quite interesting.
