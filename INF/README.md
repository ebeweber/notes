INF 350E: Principles of Interactive Design
------------------------------------------

## Course Description

"Information interaction happens all around us: on websites, in libraries, on mobile phones, and in games. Interaction design focuses on experiences with the objects of design. An interaction designer asks about the experience of an interface. A game is one example of a particularly rich interactive object. A game incorporates more than just principles of play; many video games, for example, include elements of information interaction such as interface design (what are the controls, how does the interface appear?), instructional design (how does the player know what to do?), and information architecture (what are the rules, or the mechanics of play?). This class serves as an introduction to principles from interaction design that can inform game design."
